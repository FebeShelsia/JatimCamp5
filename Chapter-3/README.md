### Welcome to Chapter 3

Before we begin this chapter, we need to install some packages on python

* Airflow Python
**Apache** Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform. It started at Airbnb in October 2014 as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.

Make sure the output from pip ananconda
```sh
which pip
~/Users/adamwidibagaskarta/anaconda3/bin/pip
```

If pip does not comes up like that, install it first
```sh
conda install pip
```

After the requirement statisfy, we can install airflow
```sh
pip install apache-airflow
```

* PETL Python
**PETL** is a general purpose Python package for extracting, transforming and loading tables of data.
Continue to first notebook

```sh
pip install petl
```
